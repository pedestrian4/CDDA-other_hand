# CDDA-other_hand
A simple mod that allows player to hold stuffs with the other hand in CDDA.

I made a mode that allows me to hold and carry items with my other hand, as it was unreasonable to only be able to carry one item in Cataclysm.

I added a permanent storage space to the character called the "other hand."

It works like a holster, and only one item can be stored, and the interference level on one arm and hand increases depending on the volume of the item stored.

Application: Crafted in the recipe (only one can be worn).
