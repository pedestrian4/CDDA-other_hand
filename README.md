# CDDA-other_hand
A simple mod that allows players to hold items with a secondary hand in CDDA.

I thought it was unreasonable that players could only carry one item at a time, created this mod.

It adds a permanent storage slot to the character called 'other hand' that functions like a holster, where only one item can be stored, and the encumbrance on one arm and hand increases depending on the item's volume.

Application: This is crafted using a recipe, and the character can only wear one. Hide it once you have made it if you want.
